Hi👋🏻This is Ming!

I am a `Software Developer`👩🏻‍💻 with 4+ years of experience in software development. Enjoyed in problem-solving and debugging. Committed to continuous learning and staying up to date with new technologies.

My educational background, including a Bachelor of Engineering in `Information Engineering` from CUHK🎓, has equipped me with a strong foundation in software development and problem-solving. I have also achieved proficiency in a variety of programming languages, such as JAVA, C#, and C++, as well as web development technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Vue.

I enjoy movie 🎬🍿 and travel 🧳 at my free time.
